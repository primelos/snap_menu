### What I learned

In this project I used the pages width to determine which image should be rendered using useEffect. I could of done it with css but I wanted to try something different. In mobile view I wanted to go a little farther with the menu. I created my own modal for the menu, if menu is open and you click out side of the container it closes done using useRef and useEffect. I used Material UI for the buttons and nav bar. In order to make it resemble the design images I had to adjust the MUI css. It was a fun project!
